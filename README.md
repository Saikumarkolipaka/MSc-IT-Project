ASSISTED BRAIN TUMOR DETECTION

I. INTRODUCTION

In todayâ€™s world Artificial Intelligence is revolutionizing Healthcare in many areas such as: Disease Diagnosis
with medical imaging, Surgical Robots and Maximizing Hospital Efficiency. Deep learning has been proven to be
superior in detecting diseases from X-rays, MRI scans and CT scans which could significantly improve the speed
and accuracy of diagnosis. The MRI Scans are collected and the model is developed. This would drastically reduce
the cost of cancer diagnosis & help in early diagnosis of tumors which would essentially be a life saver
A tumor is a collection of aberrant cells that form a tissue. These aberrant cells consume regular body cells, kill
them, and continue to expand in size. Brain tumor is one of these tumors.Nerve cells, brain cells, glands, and
membranes thatsurround the brain are all affected. Imaging and pathology can both be used to diagnose a tumor.
An MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scan of a brain tumor produces a cross-section picture of the
brain. In this report, we provide two models based on Artificial Convolutional Neural Networks that uses
mathematical formulae and algebraic operations to analyze and predict if the tumor exists and to localize
the area of tumor on MRI Images.
